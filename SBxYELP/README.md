How to run the app:
Download Android Studio (https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) 
Copy code from GitHub repository (link in part 3 of report) - each individual file in GitHub is a new file in Android Studios.
If no Android phone, open an emulator (Android Studio comes with one); the emulator will also open automatically when the application is run.
To compile the code and open the app, just hit run on Android Studio (green triangle). There is also a run option in the toolbar that can be used instead of the green triangle.
