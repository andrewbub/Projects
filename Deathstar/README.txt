My Pygame project is similar to the Deathstar game from class.

CONTROLS:
Move the deathstar up, down, left, and right by using the W, S, A, D keys, respectively.
Pressing these keys increases the velocity in that direction. 
To stop the Deathstar, press the opposite direction key to cancel out the velocity.

The Deathstar will point in the direction of the mouse position. 
To fire the laser, click.
