Challenge IB: Isomorphic Mapping

Given pairs of words s and t, determine if the words are isomorphic: That is, there exists a mapping that translates all of the letters of s into t:
	* All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. 
	* No two characters may map to the same character but a character may map to itself.

Sample Input                    Sample Output
foo bar                         Not Isomorphic
dad mom                         Isomorphic
