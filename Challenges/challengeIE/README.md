Challenge IE: Binary Strings

Given a length N and a count K, generate all the binary strings with exactly K 1's.  Print them out in lexicographical order (separate output with a blank line between cases).  You will need to support binary strings of K <= N <= 16.

Sample Input:
4 3
4 4

Sample Output:
0111
1011
1101
1110
