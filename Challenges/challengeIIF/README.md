Challenge IIF: Taco a la Biohack

The instructor is still biohacking, but is looking for a compromise because he loves tacos.  The deal he reached with his wife is as follows:
	For each taco i with ci calories that 
	he eats, he must walk at least 2j x c 
	(where j is the number tacos he has 
	already eaten) miles to maintain his 
	weight.
Given the individual calorie counts for each of the n tacos, print a long integer denoting the minimum number of miles the instructor must walk to maintain his weight. Note that he can eat the tacos in any order.

Input:            Output:    
3                 11            Given 3 tacos with calories 1, 3, and 2
1 3 2                           the instructor will need to walk 11 
                                miles.
