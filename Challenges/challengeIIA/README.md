Challenge IIA: Groups

Professor Tim is not only handy with fixing broken pipes but also is an expert in social networks.  In particular, Tim studies Reddit and is interested in how people use the social media website.  For this problem, he needs your help in determining how many isolated groups there are in a graph of users.  To keep things anonymous, he assigns each user a number and then forms links between users who share a subreddit.
Given graphs, you are to return the number of isolated groups and the members of each group (in sorted order).

Input:

Output:

Graph 2 has 2 groups:
