Challenge IIE: Hip Hop

Consider the process of hopping from integer X to integer Y along integer points of the straight line. The length of each hop must be non-negative and can be one bigger than, equal to, or one smaller than the length of the previous step.  What is the minimum number of hops in order to get from X to Y? Note, the length of both the first and the last step must be 1.

Given a series of number pairs X, Y indicating the first and last integer points, output the minimum number of hops required to get from X to Y.

Input:
45 48
45 49
45 50

Output:
45 -> 48 takes 3 hops
45 -> 49 takes 3 hops
45 -> 50 takes 4 hops
